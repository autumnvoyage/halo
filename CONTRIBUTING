CONTRIBUTOR’S GUIDE

*****

This document explains the layout of the Halo repository and offers a quick
guide on getting the software up and running from source.

arbiter/  -- codebase for the Halo Arbiter backend
bastion/  -- codebase for the Halo Bastion backend
cli/      -- the Halo command-line interface, used for testing
frontend/ -- the Halo web client
util/     -- POSIX shell scripts for automating the dev process

You’ll find ‘util/build.sh’ to be the main instrument for building the backend
binaries. If you run it without arguments, it should print out what targets
are available. Specify as many of them as you like, and it will execute them
sequentially. Note that the script expects to be run from the repository root.
The build script places its output in the ‘build/’ directory beneath the repo
root, but if you want it elsewhere just set $BUILD to your desired location.
